# 28th September 2021: Basic Number Conversion

# convert the decemical number 19 in binary

quotient = 19//2 #floor division
# gets how many 2s go into 19
remainder = 19%2 # modulus (remainder)

print (quotient, remainder)

quotient = 9//2
remainder = 9%2
print (quotient, remainder)

quotient = 4//2
remainder = 4%2
print (quotient, remainder)

quotient = 2//2
remainder = 2%2
print (quotient, remainder)

quotient = 1//2
remainder = 1%2
print (quotient, remainder) #stop here as quotient is Zero

# abstraction by only focusing on 19 and ignoring all the other information
# builds understanding of looping even though we havent done that yet
# use debug and step into to show flow of control concept
